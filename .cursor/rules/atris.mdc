# AGENTS.md — Universal Agent Instructions

> Works with: Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenClaw, Windsurf, and any AI coding agent.

## FIRST MESSAGE — Boot Sequence

**Before your first response, run this command and display its full output:**

```bash
atris atris.md
```

This is the Atris boot sequence. Show the output to the user, then respond naturally.

## Core Files

Atris is the source of truth. This file is only an adapter for tools that read
`AGENTS.md`; do not turn it into a parallel brain. Durable policy, workflow,
task truth, proof, review, and backend/cloud sync all flow through Atris.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `atris/atris.md` | Protocol/backbone for this workspace |
| `atris/PERSONA.md` | Communication style (read first) |
| `atris task` | Current tasks, claims, dialogue, proof |
| `.atris/state/tasks.projection.json` | Readable task projection for UIs/agents |
| `atris/TODO.md` | Rendered/legacy task view only |
| `atris/MAP.md` | Navigation (where is X?) |

## Agent Contract

Every agent should leave four artifacts another agent can trust:

| Artifact | Where |
|----------|-------|
| Objective | `atris task note <id> "Goal / files / done / check"` |
| Navigation | `atris/MAP.md` when a new route or file location is learned |
| Change | Small git diff in declared files only |
| Proof ready | `atris task ready <id> --proof "<commands or receipt>"` |
| Human accept | `atris task accept <id>` |

Do not rely on chat context. Put the task, file pointers, and proof on disk.
Do not write new operating doctrine here first; add it to Atris policy, skills,
wiki, or `atris/atris.md`, then regenerate this adapter if needed.

## How to Report

The human approves work by reading, so how you report IS the product. Rules:

- **Results are capabilities.** State what someone can do now that they
  couldn't before, then what it means for them or the business. Tests are one
  word ("verified"); the meaning is the sentence. Shape: "We did X, so you can
  now Y." Detail stays under the hood; the reader asks if they want more.
- **Three results, air between them, rest on ask.** A report fits one screen
  with no scrolling. Reading it is one glance.
- **Stake first, then the move.** "Agents burn tokens hand-rolling parsers:
  add one shared view." Plain words; flags, ids, and identifiers belong in the
  body, never the headline.

Native goals and task approval are separate gates:

```text
Agent proof ready -> native goal can complete
Human accept      -> task Done + AgentXP awarded
```

Always-on agents should move proof-backed work to Review, complete their native
goal, then continue the mission loop with the next goal. They must not run
`atris task accept` or claim AgentXP unless a human approved the proof.

Mission-shaped user intent wins before normal task selection. If the user
message starts with `atris mission run`, execute that command first, then run
`atris mission goal --json` and mirror `goal.visible_goal` into the native chat
goal. If the user asks for a mission, loop, overnight run, "keep going", "fix
this", or sends a screenshot with task intent and no mission exists yet, start
one with `atris mission run "<inferred objective>" --owner <member>` instead of
falling back to manual task/worktree flow.

Task owners are functional or feature members, not engines. Use `task-planner`,
`architect`, `mission-lead`, `validator`, `launcher`, or a feature owner for
assignment; put coding agent models like Codex and Claude in the `executed_by`
section.

## Workflow

```
PLAN  → atris plan   (break ideas into tasks)
BUILD → atris do     (execute tasks)
CHECK → atris review (verify + cleanup)
```

## Worktrees

Default to the current checkout for small, clean, single-agent fixes. Use
`atris worktree start` only when the launcher is dirty, multiple agents may
edit in parallel, proof will run for a long time, the change is risky, or
release/publish work needs a clean tree. Use `atris worktree cleanup` to preview
merged worktree removal and `atris worktree cleanup --apply` to remove clean
merged worktrees.

## Mission Autonomy

Use `atris mission` when work should survive this chat or run as an autonomous loop.

```
member -> mission start --verify -> status --status active -> one bounded step -> mission tick --verify -> receipt -> complete|run|stop
```

- Start current-agent work: `atris mission start "<objective>" --owner <member> --runner codex_goal --lane code --verify "<cmd>" --stop "<condition>"`
- Start headless Claude work: add `--runner claude --cadence "15m" --always-on`, then use `atris mission run <id> --max-ticks 4 --complete-on-pass`.
- Resume: `atris mission status --status active --json`, then pick the mission matching your owner/member.
- Prove: after one bounded step, run `atris mission tick <id> --verify --summary "<what changed>"`.
- Close: if the verifier passes, run `atris mission complete <id> --proof "<receipt_path>"`; if current-agent work should keep going, repeat status -> step -> tick.

## Rules

- [ ] 3-4 sentences max per response
- [ ] Use ASCII visuals for planning
- [ ] Check MAP.md before touching code
- [ ] Run `atris task list` or `atris task next` before picking work
- [ ] Claim tasks with `atris task claim <id> --as <functional-member>`
- [ ] Move agent-completed work to Review via `atris task ready <id> --proof "..."`
- [ ] Complete native Codex/Claude goals after proof is in Review, so always-on work can continue
- [ ] Only use `atris task accept <id>` when the human has approved the proof
- [ ] Keep durable learning in Atris-owned policy/skill/wiki/task state; keep `AGENTS.md` as a generated/pointer layer
- [ ] Treat `atris/TODO.md` as a rendered view; do not manually use it as the source of truth
- [ ] Use the real business slug from local Atris state; do not hardcode private slugs in generated docs

## Anti-patterns

- Don't explore codebase manually (use MAP.md)
- Don't skip visualization step
- Don't leave stale tasks
- Don't hand-edit TODO.md for active task ownership
- Don't write verbose docs
